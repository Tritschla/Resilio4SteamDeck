# R4SD - Resilio4SteamDeck

I created this tool to make it easy for users to install Resilio Sync onto their SteamDeck running SteamOS 3 and above.


**Installation:** 

To install the tool, simply go to desktop mode on your Steam Deck, open a browser and download the newest version of R4SD by [right-clicking here and saving the file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tritschla/Resilio4SteamDeck/main/InstallResilio4SteamDeck.desktop) (Save link as) to your downloads folder / desktop and run it from there.

**Important information regarding SteamOS Updates**

It's important to note that due to the way SteamOS is updated by Valve, Resilio may fail to work after certain updates. To remedy this, R4SD includes a "Repair R4DS" icon on your desktop after installation. Simply use this to get Resilio working as normal.


**What is R4SD?**

R4SD is essentially a collection of scripts that makes it easy to install, maintain, or even uninstall Resilio Sync. To ensure that the original files from Resilio Sync are used on installation, R4SD downloads them from the official website. During installation, R4SD also takes care of installing all needed dependencies and creating auto-start entries so that Resilio comes up as soon as your Steam Deck boots. And the best part is that this all works in Gaming Mode, so you can sync SaveStates, Screenshots, or any other type of data without any hassle.


**Why should I use R4SD?**

Using R4SD is especially helpful for users who may not have experience with Linux or dependency of packages. This tool is built to get Resilio working so you can concentrate on the enjoyment, the Steam Deck has to offer.


**What is Resilio in the first place?**

If you're not familiar with Resilio Sync, I recommend checking out their official page at https://www.resilio.com/. It's important to note that I am not part of the Resilio team or its contributors; I simply created this tool because I wanted to get Resilio working on my SteamDeck.
If you like the work, they are doing with this tool, please consider upgrading to their "Pro Version" of Resilio Sync. 


**Who is Tritschla?**

As for me, I am an IT Systems Engineer and Operations Manager with over 15 years of experience in the field. While Linux Bash programming and scripting are not typically within my area of expertise, I created R4SD to make the process of installing Resilio Sync easier for SteamDeck users. If you find any errors, feel free to let me know, but please understand that I may not be able to fix them immediately. I hope that others with knowledge in this area will also contribute to this project.
